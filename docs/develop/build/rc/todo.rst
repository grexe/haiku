Ye Olde To Do List
##################

What will future versions of rc bring? Here are some ideas.

- Attributes, so you can also use rdef scripts to add attributes to your files instead of (or in addition to) resources.
- Expand the expressions to handle other data types besides integer data. This would include floating point (+ - * /), string (+), raw (+), and booleans (! &amp;&amp; ||).
- Allow users to create their own symbolic constants.
